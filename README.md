## Algorithms

Until now only 2 algorithms have been implemented:
- Backtracking
- QS1 based on: [How to Search for Millions of Queens](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276277375.pdf)


## How to run

- Clone the repo
- run `npm start`


## Features:

- [X] Queens
- [X] Free dimensional board
- [X] Queens attack positions
- [ ] Diplay number of iterations
- [ ] Visualize the algorithms
